## About
The Vermont Livability Map tells the story of the Vermont Zoning Atlas Project and combines data from the Vermont Zoning Atlas, the Wastewater Infrastructure Map, and a flood risk map to provide an educational exploration of how zoning and infrastructure affect livability in Vermont. It leverages open data and open-source technology to create an accessible resource that supports sustainable development, emergency preparedness, and policy analysis.

## Features
- **Zoning Visualization:** Explore data from the Vermont Zoning Atlas to understand zoning restrictions and opportunities across Vermont.
- **Infrastructure Mapping:** View wastewater infrastructure data, helping identify areas with or without access to critical services.
- **Flood Risk Assessment:** Analyze flood-prone regions to assist in resilience planning and to promote safe, sustainable development.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate Vermont’s diverse datasets in a streamlined, interactive format that simplifies complex information for easy interpretation.

## Data Layers
The following datasets are integrated into the Vermont Livability Map:
- **Vermont Zoning Atlas**: Provides insights into zoning policies across different municipalities in Vermont.
- **Wastewater Infrastructure Map**: Maps existing wastewater systems and locations in need of infrastructure upgrades.
- **Flooding Map**: Identifies flood risk areas to aid in climate adaptation and emergency preparedness.
